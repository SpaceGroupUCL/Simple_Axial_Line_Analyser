-Overview-

Theory:
-  Overview of Processing
-  What is a graph?
-  Search through the graph
-  Basic Space Syntax measures (Axial)
Practice (Processing):
-  Import data (depthmapX friendly)
-  Build the graph
-  Implement a graph search for the SS measures
-  Export data in a ‘Excel,R,depthmapX...etc friendly format’
-  Display (very basic)
